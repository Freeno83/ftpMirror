# ftpMirror
An example python helper class to help download ftp files
This directory explains python code which was written to download many files from an ftp directory.  
It is not a comprehensive piece of code and while it could be used as-is in some cases, it may require modification 
to work in your specific use case, particularly in relation to comprehensive error handling.  

The purpose of this document is to provide an example for how to use the ‘ftplib” python library 
and potentially speed up writing of your code by providing a well explained reference.
